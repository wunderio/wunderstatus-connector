Module is being used to send module information from Drupal8 sites to
Wunderstatus manager site https://github.com/wunderkraut-fi/wunderstatus/tree/manager-d8

Wunderstatus manager saves information about module and it's version for each site.
This allows to see what modules each site is using. It is useful in situations where some
modules have new security updates and you need to check which site is using old version.
